Predictive Analytics for Market Trends

This project involves developing a machine learning model to forecast market demand using historical data.

Project Structure:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Model Training with Advanced Techniques
3. Model Deployment with Flask, GUI, and Logging
4. Dockerization for Deployment
5. CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Testing and Deployment
6. Unit Testing

Files:
- data_preprocessing.py: Script for loading and preprocessing data.
- model_training.py: Script for training the machine learning model with advanced techniques.
- app.py: Flask application for deploying the model and making predictions.
- templates/index.html: HTML template for the GUI.
- logging_config.py: Configuration for logging.
- Jenkinsfile: CI/CD pipeline configuration.
- tests/test_model.py: Unit tests for the model.
- Dockerfile: Docker configuration for containerizing the application.

Usage:
1. Run `data_preprocessing.py` to preprocess the data.
2. Run `model_training.py` to train and save the model.
3. Run `app.py` to start the Flask server and access the GUI at `http://localhost:5000`.
4. Use Docker to containerize and deploy the application.
5. Use Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Flask
- joblib
- Docker
- Jenkins or GitHub Actions

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
